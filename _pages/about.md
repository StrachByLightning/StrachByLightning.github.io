I'm a **Undergraduate Senior** studying **Computer Science** at **Westerning Washington University**. Currently interested in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processesing, Data Science, Cloud Applications and Infrastructure.

I've worked as a Software Development Engineer for Slalom and Amazon. Both amazing experiences I plan to write about in my blog sometime soon! &trade; I'm always looking for a challenge, and a new opportunity to develop software.

Check out my previous work on the [projects](/projects/) page.
