I'm an **Undergraduate Senior** studying **Computer Science** at **Western Washington University**. Currently interested in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processesing, Data Science, Cloud Applications, and Back-End Development.

I've interned as a Software Development Engineer for **Slalom** and **Amazon**. Both amazing experiences I plan to write about in my blog sometime soon! &trade; I'm always looking for a challenge, and a new opportunity to develop software.

Check out my previous work on the [**projects**](/projects/) page!

Some of my favorite past times outside of computer science are [**running**](https://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/Athlete.aspx?AID=4018802), **hiking**, **reading**, and **eating**. I love the competition of **board games** and **pickup sports** (especially **soccer**), and I'm always looking to [**challenge myself by learning something new**](https://medium.com/leadership-motivation-and-impact/fixed-v-growth-mindset-902e7d0081b3).

Feel free to browse around and explore the **site**! I'm always interested in meeting new people, so feel free to shoot me an **email**, or **linkedin** message anytime!
