The future, a crazy and very exciting thing. I have alot of goals that I want to document, and what better way than through a blog! One of those goals is to become a better writer. I plan on writing weekly about different things I'm learning. The hope is people will find in interest in my journey, and it will be a good exercise for me to reflect back on my progress.

Besides documenting my learning journey onwards, I want to also reflect on some of my previous experiences.

* Competitive Racing
* Amazon Internship
* Slalom Internship
* Experience as a Computer Science Student
